## Private Deep Learning
### Implement Privacy-Aware Deep learning via Partial Homomorphic Encryption
We provide a library for the implementation of Neural Network in a layer-wise way on encrypted data.

Instead of using compute-intensive full homomorphic encryption, our library is based on Partial Homomorphic Encryption.
